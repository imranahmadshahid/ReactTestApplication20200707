You can preview this application by going on https://github.com/imranbutt/ReactTestApplication20200707 link

In this application, I used following JS libraries and frameworks:
1) React
2) Jquery
3) Datatables

In this application, I am getting data from an API and binding it with a datatables that is giving searching and sorting out of the box. I just customize and configure those settings according to the requirements.
